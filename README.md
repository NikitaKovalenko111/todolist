# Todolist

## Preview

I think every programmer has to make his own todolist and I'm not an exception. This is my own fullstack todolist.
Todolist is made using Typescript as main language.

## Technologies

### Front-end

-   React
-   Redux
-   Ant-design
-   Redux-saga
-   Axios

### Backend

-   Nest
-   Bcrypt
-   Jsonwebtoken
-   Mongoose

And some other helpful libraries...

## Main scripts

`yarn start` - starts application

`yarn start:dev` - starts application in developing mode

`yarn start:prod` - starts application in production mode

`yarn build` - builds client and server
